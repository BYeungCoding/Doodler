# Doodler
This is an android app for CISC482 a doodling app called the Doodler.
On the Doodler you can do some very simple drawing.
You have three different parameters that you can change for the brush. 
They are:
- Brush Size
- Brush Opacity
- Brush Color
**Brush Size** is a slider that sets the strokeWidth of the brush to 10 by default, but it goes from 1-100 left to right.
Brush Opacity is also a slider that sets the opacity to it's max at 255 by default, but goes down from 255-0 right to left.
Brush Color is a button that when clicked gives you a choice of 6 different colors Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Black, and White.
Finally there is a "Clear Sketch" button, as the name entails, when clicked it clears all of the drawing that has been done so far.
