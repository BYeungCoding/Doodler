# Doodler
This is an android app for CISC482 that allows you to doodle called the Doodler.\
On the Doodler you can do some very simple drawing.\
You have three different parameters that you can change for the brush.\
They are:
- Brush Size
- Brush Opacity
- Brush Color

**Brush Size** is a slider that sets the strokeWidth of the brush to 10 by default, but it goes from 1-100 left to right.\
**Brush Opacity** is also a slider that sets the opacity to it's max at 255 by default, but goes down from 255-0 right to left.\
**Brush Color** is a button that when clicked gives you a choice of 6 different colors Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Black, and White.\
Finally there is a **Clear Sketch** button, as the name entails, when clicked it clears all of the drawing that has been done so far.

### References
Most of my references were just running into an issue and not knowing how to solve it, then googling what I was trying to do and figuring it out. This involved either checking stack overflow or other forums, the Android developers documentation, or skimming through a YouTube video explaining how to do something. There are a bunch of pages that I could reference but didn't think that would be valueable as it is just a bunch of different links to the sites I said I had used.\
Here are the main sites in a list:
- [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [android developer](https://developer.android.com/)
